The fundamental rules to implement Go code

## Best Practices
- Always run `go build` after making changes
- Use `gofmt` for code formatting
- Write unit tests for new features
- Use interfaces for better abstraction
- Keep functions small and focused

## Reminders
- After change: Don't forget to run `go build` to verify your changes
- Before commit: Run all tests and linters before committing

## Code comment
- Always describe in English

## Linting
- golint
- staticcheck
- errcheck

## Formatting
- gofmt
- goimports
